Marte Partay is a game where the player, Marte, has to run to as many bases as possible in a row without getting tagged out by a Phillies player or the umpire, who has revealed his true colors as a Phillies fan trying to make sure the New York Mets do not make it to the World Series. Every time the player runs onto a base, their speed increases. If the player gets tagged out, their score and speed reset.
